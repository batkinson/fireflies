A browser-based game implemented directly in JavaScript and HTML5.

## Why?

I wanted to try out some of the capabilities of HTML5 and build a basic 2D game
engine.

## Requirements

To run this program, you'll need:

  * A web browser supporting HTML5.

## Running

Just open it with your web browser.
